## Node.js Tutorials
The node.js tutorials build a Video application. Users can add and manage videos 
to their list of videos, add categories, create an extended profile, add Song
information to the videos, search and find related videos, etc. The video app is
deliberate kept very generic so developers can use the tutorials and source code
to build their own custom video application. The video application also has support 
for API management, so that mobile applications can use the video app as a server
backend and manage API access with API keys, and further it will have support for
User Groups, categories, social features to follow, like, dislike, etc.
